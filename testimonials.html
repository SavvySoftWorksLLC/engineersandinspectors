		<br>
		&quot;I contacted Sam Sain at aaHomeInspec to see if they could assist me 
		with a structural inspection for a house that I was interested in 
		purchasing. Although I was not able to purchase that home and was 
		therefore unable to utilize their services, I was very impressed with 
		the professionalism that I encountered throughout my inquiry. Sam was 
		incredibly prompt with responding to my initial questions and was very 
		knowledgeable not only about the inspection process, but also about 
		common structural problems that exist in the neighborhood where the home 
		was located. I would highly recommend aaHomeInspec, and will look to 
		them for any necessary home inspections in the future.&quot;<br>

<p>I choose <b>aaHomeInspec</b> because I felt that the property I was purchasing
 needed more than a simple inspection. It needed a detailed structural and foundation
  evaluation. A typical home inspection would simply have resulted in recommendations
   by the inspector to bring in an engineer to evaluate the situation anyway.
    I would not have any follow through advice from the home inspector then.
	 For not all that much more than a typical inspection would cost, Sam and
	  Don who are both engineers, were not only able to find problems that might
	   not have been identified in a typical inspection, they were also able to
	    advise me on proper repairs - AND certify that the repairs recommended
		 by the contractor met the requirements. Their attention to detail and
		  follow through has been amazing.  I would highly recommend anyone
		   purchasing an older home, or one with questionable repairs, to consult
		    an engineer - and <b>aaHomeInspec definitely did a GREAT job!</b>
			 Today, lawyers charge $200/hour to talk to them, if you call them,
			  they bill you minimum of 10 minutes. A 10-minute visit to doctors
			  often is more than $100. Engineers bill their time at $150/hour.
			   Computer professionals charges $150 to $200/hour.
			    During the initial negotiation, I got unlimited professional
				 engineering support from Sam, which was worth a whole lot more.

<p>Thank you very much for your expertise and comprehensive home inspection.  You go well above and beyond what I expected as you applied your extensive knowledge of building construction and solid engineering background in the evaluation.  This is not only one of the largest investments in my life but also my home.  Although it is new construction there are still issues to reconcile that could impact the structure in the future which you so perceptively observed in your report.  I am extremely impressed with your attention to detail as you noted concerns that I overlooked the first three times I examined the house.
<p>I have been through several inspections in my life but this, by far, is the most thorough and all encompassing review I've ever experienced.  I am deeply grateful to you for your proficiency, in-depth analysis, and prompt response to my call.  I also appreciate your multiple trips to complete the inspection given the builder had not adequately prepared.
<p>Please feel free to share my contact information and comments.  Should the need of these services arise in the future, you are the first and only person I will call.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,

<p>Purchasing a home is one of the largest investments my wife and I have made.  One of our biggest concerns was the house hiding any problems that would be a safety issue to our family or cost extreme amounts of money to fix.  The old adage 'buyer beware' applies extremely in house purchases (once you own it all its problems become yours).  The house we were interested in already had a home inspection done by the seller, but since we were going to be the ones paying for this house, I wanted to make sure there were no unknown issues.
<p>So I did a lot of research and found Sam and his team.  Sam and his team are amazing; their background in engineering and 20-30 years field experience was very valuable.  He offered suggestions that were sound and unbiased.  Sam and his team were very responsive and thorough.  His analysis and report both informal and formal help us determine our course of action.  If we ever purchase another house or even build a house I know we would use Sam again, no questions.
<p>In summary if you are going to spend the amount of money that houses cost these days, I recommend using the best home inspection team you can find and in my opinion that is Sam and his team at <a href="index.html">aahomeinspec.com</a>

<p>I have purchased a number of homes over many years and have utilized the services of home inspectors many times. Prior to my last purchase, the best that I have received for the inspection fee was about 2" thick, which is cumbersome to read and offers limited help in determining the real significance of the shortcomings of the property. 
<p>This time around I called Sam and Don of AAHomeInspec.com who responded very quickly. Their inspection was most professional. I received a bound report and also got a wonderful summary and action sheet. If I had been provided with similar documents on properties purchased prior to this one, I would have negotiated for either better sales terms or improvements prior to the purchase. Being engineers enabled Sam and Don to provide a great service for me. I will recommend them for any inspection work.

<p>Being new to the area and not knowing what inspector to trust, I called aaHomeInspec after a web search.  I was impressed with the amount of information on the site and made an appointment.  Setting the appointment was easy and the cost was in-line with other home inspectors in the area.  I was able to communicate with the company via e-mail which is an important plus to a busy person like me.  Sam offered more than I expected.  This was my third home purchase and this was the best inspection yet.  As an engineer, Sam was able to provide me with more info on my home than any other inspector that I had worked with in the past.  The post inspection report and action items list were clear and extremely helpful.  I will not hesitate to recommend aaHomeInspec and will call them again for my next house purchase.

<p>Your engineering expertise was extremely valuable in resolving several structural issues with the builder.  Your inspection was a great help in developing our walk through list for the builder.  Not only did you help us in the new home, but you also saved us a considerable amount of money selling our old home.  You accurately identified the species of molds in the ductwork and they were no threat to the new buyers.  I will be glad to communicate with any of your future clients.

<p>I recently purchased a house that was in my family for over 50 years.  I was reluctant to get the house inspected because I thought I was very familiar with the house and would not reveal anything that I did not know about.  I hired Sam to perform only a water test as required by the bank.  But after talking to him for a few minutes, I realized that an average person couldn't see potential problems and existing issues even when that person was thoroughly familiar with the house.  Sam gave advice and voiced concerns, which saved me thousands of dollars.  Please let your clients know that they can e-mail me if they want any references.

<p>We found your inspection to be informative and helpful.  Your background as an engineer certainly enhances your credibility.  We have followed up on a number of things that you identified.  We found the narrative about our house to be particularly helpful in identifying both strengths and problems with the house.

<p>Sam is a professional and is educated in engineering and in home inspection.  He involves the new homebuyers during the inspection process.  I felt that I could trust his advice, which is very important being a first time homebuyer who is a single female.  Sam treats his customers as though they are friends.  I learned a lot from Sam and still consult with him.  In the future, I will utilize him to manage some of my bigger home improvement projects, e.g., Geothermal Heating and Cooling etc.
