      <div class="head3"> Q. How can I find out if my tap water is safe to drink?</div>
      <p>  A: Because of water's different sources and the different ways in which 
        water is treated, the taste and quality of drinking water varies from 
        place to place. Over 90 percent of water systems meet EPA's standards 
        for tap water quality. The best source of specific information about your 
        drinking water is your water supplier. Water suppliers that serve the 
        same people year-round are required to send their customers an <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/ccr/ccrfact.html">annual 
        water quality report</a> (sometimes called a consumer confidence report). 
        Contact your water supplier to get a copy or <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/ogwdw/ccr.nsf/America?OpenView">see 
        if your report is posted on-line</a>. For additional information, visit 
        EPA's web site's on <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwinfo.htm">local drinking water</a> (provides 
        links to state and local sources of water quality information) and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwhealth.html"> 
        drinking water and health</a> (provides information on drinking water 
        contaminants and their health effects). </p>
      <div class="head3"> Q. How will I know if my water isn't safe to drink?</div>
        <p>A: Your water supplier must notify you by newspaper, mail, radio, TV, 
        or hand-delivery if your water doesn't meet EPA or state standards or 
        if there is a waterborne disease emergency. The notice will describe any 
        precautions you need to take, such as boiling your water. Follow the advice 
        of your water supplier if you ever receive such a notice. The most common 
        drinking water emergency is contamination by disease-causing germs. Boiling 
        your water for one minute will kill these germs. You can also use common 
        household bleach or iodine to disinfect your drinking water at home in 
        an emergency, such as a flood (see EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/faq/emerg.html">emergency 
        disinfection fact sheet</a> for specific directions on how to disinfect 
        your drinking water in an emergency). </p>
      
	  <div class="head3"> Q. What's this new drinking water report that I've heard about?</div>
<p>A. Water suppliers must deliver to their customers annual drinking water 
        quality reports (or <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/ccr/ccrfact.html">consumer confidence 
        reports</a>). These reports will tell consumers what contaminants have 
        been detected in their drinking water, how these detection levels compare 
        to drinking water standards, and where their water comes from. The reports 
        must be provided annually before July 1, and, in most cases, are mailed 
        directly to customers' homes. Contact your water supplier to get a copy 
        of your report, or <a href= 

         "http://yosemite.epa.gov/ogwdw/ccr.nsf/America?OpenView">see if your 
        report is posted on-line</a>. </p>
      <a name="test"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. How can I get my water tested?</div>
<p>A.: If your home is served by a water system, get a copy of your <a

         href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/ogwdw/ccr.nsf/America?OpenView">annual 
        water quality report</a> before you test your water. This report will 
        tell you what contaminants have been found in your drinking water and 
        at what level. After you've read this report, you may wish to test for 
        specific contaminants (such as lead) that can vary from house to house, 
        or any other contaminant you're concerned about. EPA does not test individual 
        homes, and cannot recommend specific laboratories to test your drinking 
        water. States certify water testing laboratories. You may call your <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/faq/sco.html">state 
        certification officer</a> to get a list of certified laboratories in your 
        state. Depending on how many contaminants you test for, a water test can 
        cost from $15 to hundreds of dollars. </p>

      <a name="mcl"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. What is a drinking water standard?</div>
<p>A. Under the authority of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/sdwa/sdwa.html">Safe Drinking 
        Water Act</a> (SDWA), EPA sets standards for approximately 90 contaminants 
        in drinking water. For each of these contaminants, EPA sets a legal limit, 
        called a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/mcl.html"> maximum contaminant level</a>, or requires 
        a certain treatment. Water suppliers may not provide water that doesn't 
        meet these standards. Water that meets these standards is safe to drink, 
        although <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/crypto.html">people with severely compromised immune 
        systems</a> and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/kids/kidshealth/index.html">children</a> may have special 
        needs. For a more detailed description, read about <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/standard/setting.html">how 
        standards are set</a> or about EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/about.html">Office of 
        Ground Water and Drinking Water</a>. </p>
      <a name="2ndary"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. I don't like the taste/smell/appearance of my tap water. What's 
        wrong with it?</div>
<p>A. Even when water meets EPA's standards, you may still object to its 
        taste, smell, or appearance. EPA sets <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/consumer/2ndstandards.html">secondary 
        standards</a> based on these aesthetic characteristics (not health effects) 
        which water systems and states can choose to adopt. Common complaints 
        about water aesthetics include temporary cloudiness (typically caused 
        by air bubbles) or chlorine taste (which can be improved by letting the 
        water stand exposed to the air).</p>
      <a name="contams"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. I'm worried about a specific drinking water contaminant [lead, 
        Cryptosporidium, nitrate, radon, etc.]. What should I know?</div>
        Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to 
        contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. As long as they occur 
        below EPA's standards, they don't pose a significant threat to health, 
        although people with severely compromised immune systems and children 
        may have special needs. For more information about a specific contaminant, 
        see EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/hfacts.html">fact sheets on drinking water contaminants</a>, 
        which have more detailed information on every contaminant EPA currently 
        sets standards for and those EPA is considering setting standards for.

      <br><br>
      <a name="compromised"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. What if I have a severely compromised immune system?</div>
<p>A. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water 
        than the general population. People with severely compromised immune systems, 
        such as people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, people who have undergone 
        organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, 
        some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. 
        These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health 
        care providers. <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/crypto.html">EPA/Centers for Disease Control 
        guidelines</a> on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection from 
        Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants offer more detailed advice.

      <br><br>
      <a name="pwell"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. <b>W</b>hat should I do if I have my own drinking water well?</div>
<p>A.: If you have your own well, you are responsible for making sure that 
        your water is safe to drink. Private wells should be tested annually for 
        nitrate and coliform bacteria to detect contamination problems early. 
        Test more frequently and for other contaminants, such as radon or pesticides, 
        if you suspect a problem. Check with your local health department and 
        local public water systems that use ground water to learn more about well 
        water quality in your area and what contaminants you are more likely to 
        find. More information is available on <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/privatewells/index2.html">EPA's 
        page for private well owners</a> . You can help protect your water supply 
        by carefully managing activities near the water source. The organization 
        <a href="http://www.uwex.edu/farmasyst/">Farm*A*Syst/Home*A*Syst</a> provides information to help farmers and rural residents 
        assess pollution risks and develop management plans to meet their unique 
        needs. </p>
      <a name="bw"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. What about bottled water?</div>
<p>A.: Bottled water is not necessarily safer than your tap water. EPA sets 
        standards for tap water provided by public water systems; the Food and 
        Drug Administration sets bottled water standards based on EPA's tap water 
        standards. Bottled water and tap water are both safe to drink if they 
        meet these standards, although <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/crypto.html">people with severely 
        compromised immune systems</a> and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/kids/index.html">children</a> 
        may have special needs. Some bottled water is treated more than tap water, 
        while some is treated less or not treated at all. Bottled water costs 
        much more than tap water on a per gallon basis. Bottled water is valuable 
        in emergency situations (such as floods and earthquakes), and high quality 
        bottled water may be a desirable option for people with weakened immune 
        systems. Consumers who choose to purchase bottled water should carefully 
        read its label to understand what they are buying, whether it is a better 
        taste, or a certain method of treatment. </p>
      <p> More information on bottled water is available from the        <a href="http://www.bottledwater.org/">International Bottled Water Association</a>,  
        which represents most US bottlers. </p>
      <a name="hwtu"></a> 
      <div class="head3"> Q. What about home water treatment units?</div>
<p>A.: Most people do not need to treat their drinking water at home to make 
        it safe. A home water treatment unit can improve water's taste, or provide 
        an extra margin of safety for people more vulnerable to the effects of 
        waterborne illness (<a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/crypto.html">people with severely compromised 
        immune systems</a> and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/kids/index.html">children</a> may 
        have special needs). Consumers who choose to purchase a home water treatment 
        unit should carefully read its product information to understand what 
        they are buying, whether it is a better taste or a certain method of treatment. 
        Be certain to follow the manufacturer's instructions for operation and 
        maintenance, especially changing the filter on a regular basis. EPA neither 
        endorses nor recommends specific home water treatment units. EPA does 
        register units that make germ-killing claims (contact the National Antimicrobial 
        Information Network at 800/447-6349 for more information). No single unit 
        takes out every kind of drinking water contaminant; you must decide which 
        type best meets your needs. </p>
      <p>
	  For help in picking a unit, contact one of the following independent non-profit 
      organizations:<br>
      <a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer/">NSF International</a> (877/8-NSF-HELP), 
      the <a href="http://www.ul.com/water/"> Underwriters Laboratories Inc.</a> (888-547-8851), 
      and the <a href="http://www.wqa.org/">Water Quality Association</a> 
      (630-505-0160). Both NSF International and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. 
      test and certify home water treatment units. The Water Quality Association 
      classifies units according to the contaminants they remove as well as listing 
      units that have earned their &#8220;Gold Seal&#8221; approval. Water treatment 
      units certified by these organizations will indicate certification on their 
      packaging or labels.

      <div class="head3"> Q. Where does my drinking water come from?</div>
<p>A. Drinking water can come from either ground water sources (via wells) 
        or surface water sources (such as rivers, lakes, and streams). Nationally, 
        most water systems use a ground water source (80%), but most people (66%) 
        are served by a water system that uses surface water. This is because 
        large metropolitan areas tend to rely on surface water, whereas small 
        and rural areas tend to rely on ground water. In addition, 10-20% of people 
        have their own private well for drinking water. To find the source of 
        your drinking water, check your annual water quality report or call your 
        water supplier. You can get more information about specific watersheds 
        by visiting EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/win/">Watershed Information 
        Network</a>. You can also learn more about EPA, state, and other efforts 
        to <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/protect.html">protect sources of drinking water</a>. </p>

      <div class="head3"> Q. How can I help protect my drinking water?</div>
<p>A.: Drinking water protection is a community-wide effort, beginning with 
        protecting the source of your water, and including education, funding, 
        and conservation. Many communities already have established source water 
        protection programs. Call your local water supplier to find out if your 
        community participates. You can also support efforts to improve operation, 
        maintenance, and construction of water treatment processes. States are 
        now engaged in source water assessments, to work with communities to identify 
        local sources of contamination. You can contact your <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwinfo.htm">state 
        source water protection program</a> to find out how to get involved in 
        this process, or join a local group in <a href="http://www.epa.gov/adopt/">Adopting 
        a Watershed</a>. </p>
