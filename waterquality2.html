            <blockquote> 
              <div class="head3">Q: What is a CCR?</div>
              <p>A: The Consumer Confidence Report, or CCR, is an annual water 
                quality report that a community water system is required to provide 
                to its customers. The CCR contains information about substances 
                detected in your drinking water, possible sources of the substances, 
                potential health effects of the substances and other valuable 
                information.</p>
              <div class="head3">Q: When will I receive my Annual Water Quality Report (CCR)?</div>
              <p>A: Community water systems are required to provide the CCR to 
                customers by July 1 of each year. The report contains water quality 
                information from the previous calendar year. </p>
              <div class="head3">Q: I received a water quality report from my water system. Does 
                this report indicate there is something wrong with the water, 
                or that it&#8217;s unsafe? </div>
              <p>A: Every Community Water System (CWS) is required by law to provide 
                its customers with a water quality report also known as a Consumer 
                Confidence Report (CCR). The CCR is a general overview of the 
                water quality. This report lists the regulated contaminants the 
                CWS detected in treated water and the level at which they were 
                found for the preceding calendar year. </p>
              <p>For each detected contaminant, the report must contain the following 
                pieces of information in a table; maximum contaminant level goal 
                (MCLG), maximum contaminant level (MCL), level of contaminant 
                detected, likely contaminant source, and notation of any violation. 
                The Hotline can provide general information concerning the required 
                content for the CCR. Contact your local water system for specific 
                information about local water quality. </p>
              <div class="head3">Q: What do MCL, MCLG and MRDL mean?</div>
              <p>A: Each CCR should contain a section of definitions, which explains 
                what these terms mean. Below is a table of definitions. </p>
              <p><strong>Important Drinking Water Definitions</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>MCLG: Maximum Contaminant Level Goal: The level of a contaminant 
                  in drinking water below which there is no known or expected 
                  risk to health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety.</li>
                <li>MCL: Maximum Contaminant Level: The highest level of a contaminant 
                  that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to 
                  the MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment technology.</li>
                <li>TT: Treatment Technique: A required process intended to reduce 
                  the level of a contaminant in drinking water.<br>
                  AL: Action Level: The concentration of a contaminant which, 
                  if exceeded, triggers treatment or other requirements which 
                  a water system must follow.</li>
                <li>Variances and Exemptions: State or EPA permission not to meet 
                  an MCL or a treatment technique under certain conditions.</li>
                <li>MRDLG: Maximum residual disinfection level goal. The level 
                  of a drinking water disinfectant below which there is no known 
                  or expected risk to health. MRDLGs do not reflect the benefits 
                  of the use of disinfectants to control microbial contaminants.</li>
                <li>MRDL: Maximum residual disinfectant level. The highest level 
                  of a disinfectant allowed in drinking water. There is convincing 
                  evidence that addition of a disinfectant is necessary for control 
                  of microbial contaminants.</li>
                <li>MNR: Monitored Not Regulated</li>
                <li>MPL: State Assigned Maximum Permissible Level</li>
              </ul>

            <div class="head2"><a name="crypt"></a>Cryptosporidium / Immunocompromised</div>
            <blockquote> 
              <div class="head3">Q: Why did my CCR contain information on cryptosporidium? What 
                can I do if I am immunocompromised? </div>
              <p>A: A section concerning cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants 
                is required in all CCRs to provide information for immunocompromised 
                persons such as individuals with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, 
                persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS 
                or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants. The 
                section does not indicate the presence of cryptosporidium in drinking 
                water. A guidance document developed jointly by EPA and CDC for 
                people who may be immunocompromised is available online at www.epa.gov/safewater/crypto.html. 
                This guidance provides important information for immunocompromised 
                individuals. You can order hard copies of this guidance through 
                the SDW Hotline.</p>
              <div class="head3">Q: Does my public water system treat the water for cryptosporidium? 
              </div>
              <p>A: Contact your water system to inquire about its cryptosporidium 
                removal practices. </p>
              <div class="head3">Q: What the health effects are associated with cryptosporidium? 
              </div>
              <p>A: Cryptosporidium can cause gastrointestinal illness (e.g., 
                diarrhea, vomiting, cramps). Other health effects information 
                concerning cryptosporidium is available online at www.epa.gov/safewater/crypto.html.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <div class="head2"><a name="lead"></a>Lead in Drinking Water</div>
            <blockquote> 
              <div class="head3">Q: Is there a safe level of lead in drinking water for children?</div>
              <p>A: EPA has set the maximum contaminant level goal for lead at 
                zero because lead is a toxic metal that can be harmful to human 
                health even at low exposure levels, it is persistent, and it can 
                bioaccumulate in the body over time. The Center for Disease Control 
                and Prevention recommends intervention when the level of lead 
                in a child's blood is 10 micrograms per deciliter or greater. 
                It is important to recognize all the ways a child can be exposed 
                to lead. Children are exposed to lead in paint, dust, soil, air, 
                and food, as well as drinking water. Therefore, the amount of 
                lead a child can be exposed to in drinking water before exceeding 
                the recommended blood level depends upon the amount of lead coming 
                from these other sources. Young children, infants, and fetuses 
                are particularly vulnerable to lead because the physical and behavioral 
                effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than 
                in adults. A dose of lead that would have little affect on an 
                adult can have a significant affect on a child. In children, low 
                levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and 
                peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, 
                impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood 
                cells.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <div class="head2"><a name="monitoring"></a>Monitoring Waiver</div>
            <blockquote> 
              <div class="head3">Q: Why does the current CCR contain results from previous calendar 
                years? </div>
              <p>A: Federal regulations require that if a system is allowed to 
                monitor for regulated contaminants less often than once a year, 
                the table must include the date and results of the most recent 
                sampling. Thus, the report may reflect the date and result of 
                the last samples taken. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <div class="head2"><a name="hotline"></a>Safe Drinking Water Hotline</div>
            <blockquote> 
              <div class="head3">Q: Why is the Safe Drinking Water Hotline's 800 number listed 
                in the report if the Hotline cannot provide local water quality 
                information? </div>
              <p>A: Systems are required to provide a name and telephone contact 
                at the water system who can answer questions about the report. 
                In addition, a toll free number for EPA's Safe Drinking Water 
                Hotline is provided to offer another source of information at 
                no cost to the customer. The Hotline provides general information 
                about CCRs and other safe drinking water issues. Hotline staff 
                can also direct callers to sources for additional information, 
                and can assist people in understanding the purpose and language 
                of the CCRs.</p>
