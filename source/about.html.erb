          When buying an existing home or building a brand new one, home inspection by educated and experienced home inspectors will protect investment for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a nominal expense, one can get a wealth of information about the home you are going to buy. We work for our clients to make their new home purchase experiences better. We avoid any conflict of interest, providing our client maximum satisfaction and peace of mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's homes are complex. Mechanical, structural and electrical components of any house could be fairly elaborate. We strictly follow (ASHI) <a target="_new" href="http://www.ashi.org/">American Society of Home Inspectors</a> standards and code of ethics. We do not have any conflict of interest and we do not bid on any work on the property we inspect.
        </p>
        <p>
          When client requires, we write contracts and scope of work for repairs. We supervise and inspect repair work at the request of the client.
        </p>
