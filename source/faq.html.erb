      <p><strong>Q. Who exactly would require a home inspection?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A. When buying a new home, new construction home or a pre-owned home, you need an inspection for your peace of mind. Sellers also benefit from home inspections by knowing the condition of their home before listing. They are spared the embarrassment of the buyers home inspector finding major defects with their home that they were not aware of and possibly will hold up the real estate transaction. If your new home still has a home warranty through a builder it is smart to have a home inspection before it expires.

      <p><strong>Q. I've checked this house out thoroughly myself, why do I need an inspection?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A. Inspectors have the training, experience and competence that comes with being in the industry and inspecting hundreds of homes. We know what to look for and what to look at. Considering the average home, there are literally hundreds items that should be inspected.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you or someone you may know can examine the home and roughly determine the overall condition of it, inspectors inspect homes daily, each and every week throughout the year and know exactly what to look for in a home. We detect minor/major flaws, defects in workmanship, proper installation and construction parameters and unsafe conditions that the general public would miss.
