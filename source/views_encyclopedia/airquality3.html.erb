  <p><strong class="bold-color">RADON (Rn)</strong></p>
  <p>
    The most common source of <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon" target="_blnak">indoor radon</a> is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.  Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps.  When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any home may have a radon problem.  This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes radon enters the home through well water.  In a small number of homes, the building materials can give off radon, too.  However, building materials rarely cause radon problems by themselves.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects of Radon</strong></p>
  <p>
    The predominant health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer.  Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year.  EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States--however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.

    You can't see radon, but it's not hard to find out if you have a radon problem in your home.  Testing is easy and should only take a little of your time.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    There are many kinds of inexpensive, do-it-yourself radon test kits you can get through the mail and in hardware stores and other retail outlets.  Make sure you buy a test kit that has passed EPA's testing program or is state-certified.  These kits will usually display the phrase "Meets EPA Requirements."  If you prefer, or if you are buying or selling a home, you can hire a trained contractor to do the testing for you.  EPA's voluntary <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/images/rmpqa.pdf" target="_blank">National Radon Proficiency Program (RPP)</a> evaluated testing (measurement) contractors.  A contractor who had met EPA's requirements  carried an EPA-generated RPP identification card.  EPA provided a list of companies and individual contractors on this web site which was also available to state radon offices.  You should  call your state radon office to obtain a list of qualified contractors in your area.You can also contact either the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) - <a href="http://www.neha.org/" target="_blank">http://www.neha.org</a> or the National Radon Safety Board (NRSB) - <a href="http://www.nrsb.org/" target="_blank">http://www.nrsb.org</a> for a list of proficient radon measurement and/or mitigation contractors.

  <p><strong class="bold-color">ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE (ETS)</strong></p>
  <p>
    Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the mixture of smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and smoke exhaled by the smoker. It is a complex mixture of over 4,000 compounds, more than 40 of which are known to cause cancer in humans or animals and many of which are strong irritants.  ETS is often referred to as "secondhand smoke" and exposure to ETS is often called "passive smoking."
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke</strong></p>
  <p>
    In 1992, EPA completed a major assessment of the respiratory health risks of ETS (Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking:  Lung Cancer and Other Disorders EPA/600/6-90/006F). The report concludes that exposure to ETS is responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year in nonsmoking adults and impairs the respiratory health of hundreds of thousands of children.
  </p>

  <p>
    Infants and young children whose parents smoke in their presence are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and bronchitis) and are more likely to have symptoms of respiratory irritation like cough, excess phlegm, and wheeze.  EPA estimates that passive smoking annually causes between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year.  These children may also have a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, which can lead to ear infections.  Older children who have been exposed to secondhand smoke may have slightly reduced lung function.
  </p>

  <p>
    Asthmatic children are especially at risk.  EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year.  EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year.  Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, nose, and throat irritation.  It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/" target="_blank">IAQ Publications</a> page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Reducing Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke</strong></p>
  <p><strong class="bold-color">Don't smoke at home or permit others to do so.  Ask smokers to smoke outdoors.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    The 1986 Surgeon General's report concluded that physical separation of smokers and nonsmokers in a common air space, such as different rooms within the same house, may reduce - but will not eliminate - non-smokers' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">If smoking indoors cannot be avoided, increase ventilation in the area where smoking takes place.</strong></p>
 
  <blockquote>
    Open windows or use exhaust fans.  Ventilation, a common method of reducing exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will reduce but not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.  Because smoking produces such large amounts of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not remove them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to significantly reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially.  Consequently, the most effective way to reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking there.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Do not smoke if children are present, particularly infants and toddlers.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Children are particularly susceptible to the effects of passive smoking.  Do not allow baby-sitters or others who work in your home to smoke indoors. Discourage others from smoking around children. Find out about the smoking policies of the day care center providers, schools, and other care givers for your children.  The policy should protect children from exposure to ETS.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS</strong></p>

  <p>
    Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.
  </p>

  <p>
    By controlling the relative humidity level in a home, the growth of some sources of biologicals can be minimized. A relative humidity of 30-50 percent is generally recommended for homes.  Standing water, water-damaged materials, or wet surfaces also serve as a breeding ground for molds, mildews, bacteria, and insects. House dust mites, the source of one of the most powerful biological allergens, grow in damp, warm environments.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects From Biological Contaminants</strong></p>

  <p>
    Some biological contaminants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.  Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air.  Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins.  Symptoms of health problems caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Allergic reactions occur only after repeated exposure to a specific biological allergen.  However, that reaction may occur immediately upon re-exposure or after multiple exposures over time.  As a result, people who have noticed only mild allergic reactions, or no reactions at all, may suddenly find themselves very sensitive to particular allergens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are associated with exposure to toxins from microorganisms that can grow in large building ventilation systems. However, these diseases can also be traced to microorganisms that grow in home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Children, elderly people, and people with breathing problems, allergies, and lung diseases are particularly susceptible to disease-causing biological agents in the indoor air.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Reducing Exposure to Biological Contaminants</strong></p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Install and use exhaust fans that are vented to the outdoors in kitchens and bathrooms and vent clothes dryers outdoors.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    These actions can eliminate much of the moisture that builds up from everyday activities. There are exhaust fans on the market that produce little noise, an important consideration for some people.  Another benefit to using kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans is that they can reduce levels of organic pollutants that vaporize from hot water used in showers and dishwashers.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Ventilate the attic and crawl spaces to prevent moisture build-up.</strong></p>
 
  <blockquote>
    Keeping humidity levels in these areas below 50 percent can prevent water condensation on building materials.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If using cool mist or ultrasonic humidifiers, clean appliances according to manufacturer's instructions and refill with fresh water daily.
  </p>
 
  <blockquote>
    Because these humidifiers can become breeding grounds for biological contaminants, they have the potential for causing diseases such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis and humidifier fever. Evaporation trays in air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and refrigerators should also be cleaned frequently.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Thoroughly clean and dry water-damaged carpets and building materials (within 24 hours if possible) or consider removal and replacement.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Water-damaged carpets and building materials can harbor mold and bacteria. It is very difficult to completely rid such materials of biological contaminants.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Keep the house clean. House dust mites, pollens, animal dander, and other allergy-causing agents can be reduced, although not eliminated, through regular cleaning.
  </p>
 
  <blockquote>
    People who are allergic to these pollutants should use allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room furnishings that accumulate dust, especially if they cannot be washed in hot water.  Allergic individuals should also leave the house while it is being vacuumed because vacuuming can actually increase airborne levels of mite allergens and other biological contaminants. Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may also be of help.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Take steps to minimize biological pollutants in basements.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Clean and disinfect the basement floor drain regularly. Do not finish a basement below ground level unless all water leaks are patched and outdoor ventilation and adequate heat to prevent condensation are provided.  Operate a dehumidifier in the basement if needed to keep relative humidity levels between 30-50 percent.

  <p><strong class="bold-color">STOVES, HEATERS, FIREPLACES, AND CHIMNEYS</strong></p>

  <p>
    In addition to environmental tobacco smoke, other sources of combustion products are unvented kerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves. The major pollutants released are carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particles.  Unvented kerosene heaters may also generate acid aerosols.
  </p>

  <P>
    Combustion gases and particles also come from chimneys and flues that are improperly installed or maintained and cracked furnace heat exchangers. Pollutants from fireplaces and woodstoves with no dedicated outdoor air supply can be "back-drafted" from the chimney into the living space, particularly in weatherized homes.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects of Combustion Products</strong></p>

  <p>
    <strong class="bold-color">Carbon monoxide</strong> (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body.  At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death.  Lower concentrations can cause a range of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, nausea, confusion, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in people with chronic heart disease.  The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are sometimes confused with the flu or food poisoning.  Fetuses, infants, elderly people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong class="bold-color">Nitrogen dioxide</strong> is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong class="bold-color">Particles</strong>, released when fuels are incompletely burned, can lodge in the lungs and irritate or damage lung tissue. A number of pollutants, including radon and benzo(a)pyrene, both of which can cause cancer, attach to small particles that are inhaled and then carried deep into the lung.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Reducing Exposure to Combustion Products in Homes</strong></p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Take special precautions when operating fuel-burning unvented space heaters.</strong></p>
 
  <blockquote>
    Consider potential effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Install and use exhaust fans over gas cooking stoves and ranges and keep the burners properly adjusted.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper adjustment, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Keep woodstove emissions to a minimum. Choose properly sized new stoves that are certified as meeting EPA emission standards.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Make certain that doors in old woodstoves are tight-fitting. Use aged or cured (dried) wood only and follow the manufacturer's directions for starting, stoking, and putting out the fire in woodstoves.  Chemicals are used to pressure-treat wood; such wood should never be burned indoors. (Because some old gaskets in woodstove doors contain asbestos, when replacing gaskets refer to the instructions in the CPSC, ALA, and EPA booklet, <a href="http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/ashome.html" target="_blank">Asbestos in Your Home</a>, to avoid creating an asbestos problem. New gaskets are made of fiberglass.)
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Have central air handling systems, including furnaces, flues, and chimneys, inspected annually andpromptly repair cracks or damaged parts.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Blocked, leaking, or damaged chimneys or flues release harmful combustion gases and particles and even fatal concentrations of carbon monoxide. Strictly follow all service and maintenance procedures recommended by the manufacturer, including those that tell you how frequently to change the filter. If manufacturer's instructions are not readily available, change filters once every month or two during periods of use. Proper maintenance is important even for new furnaces because they can also corrode and leak combustion gases, including carbon monoxide.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS</strong></p>
  <p>
    Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products.  Fuels are made up of organic chemicals.  All of these products can release organic compounds while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored.
  </p>

  <p>
    EPA's Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas. Additional TEAM studies indicate that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects of Household Chemicals</strong></p>
  <p>
    The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly,  from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effect.  As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed.  Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics.  At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes.  Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Reducing Exposure to Household Chemicals</strong></p>
  <p><strong class="bold-color">Follow label instructions carefully.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Potentially hazardous products often have warnings aimed at reducing exposure of the user. For example, if a label says to use the product in a well-ventilated area, go outdoors or in areas equipped with an exhaust fan to use it.  Otherwise, open up windows to provide the maximum amount of outdoor air possible.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Throw away partially full containers of old or unneeded chemicals safely.</strong></p>
 
  <blockquote>
    Because gases can leak even from closed containers, this single step could help lower concentrations of organic chemicals in your home.  (Be sure that materials you decide to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilated area but are also safely out of reach of children.)  Do not simply toss these unwanted products in the garbage can.  Find out if your local government or any organization in your community sponsors special days for the collection of toxic household wastes. If such days are available, use them to dispose of the unwanted containers safely. If no such collection days are available, think about organizing one.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Buy limited quantities.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    If you use products only occasionally or seasonally, such as paints, paint strippers, and kerosene for space heaters or gasoline for lawn mowers, buy only as much as you will use right away.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Keep exposure to emissions from products containing methylene chloride to a minimum.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Consumer products that contain <B>methylene chloride</B> include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints.  Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals.  Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with exposure to carbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels containing health hazard information and cautions on the proper use of these products.  Use products that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors only if the area is well ventilated.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Keep exposure to benzene to a minimum.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Benzene is a known human carcinogen.  The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will reduce benzene exposure include eliminating smoking within the home, providing for maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies and special fuels that will not be used immediately.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Keep exposure to perchloroethylene emissions from newly dry-cleaned materials to a minimum.</strong></p>
 
  <blockquote>
    Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning.  In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing.  Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes.  Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">FORMALDEHYDE</strong></p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/formalde.html" target="_blank">Formaldehyde</a> is an important chemical used widely by industry to manufacture building materials and  numerous household products. It is also a by-product of combustion and certain other natural processes. Thus, it may be present in substantial concentrations both indoors and outdoors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters.  Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in manufactured products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.
  </p>

  <p>
    In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include:  particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other pressed wood products, such as softwood plywood and flake or oriented strandboard, are produced for exterior construction use and contain the dark, or red/black-colored phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin. Although formaldehyde is present in both types of resins, pressed woods that contain PF resin generally emit formaldehyde at considerably lower rates than those containing UF resin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has permitted only the use of plywood and particleboard that conform to specified formaldehyde emission limits in the construction of prefabricated and mobile homes. In the past, some of these homes had elevated levels of formaldehyde because of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products used in their construction and because of their relatively small interior space.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rate at which products like pressed wood or textiles release formaldehyde can change.  Formaldehyde emissions will generally decrease as products age. When the products are new, high indoor temperatures or humidity can cause increased release of formaldehyde from these products.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects of Formaldehyde</strong></p>

  <p>
    Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Reducing Exposure to Formaldehyde in Homes</strong></p>
  <p>
    Ask about the formaldehyde content of pressed wood products,including building materials, cabinetry, and furniture before you purchase them.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    If you experience adverse reactions to formaldehyde, you may want to avoid the use of pressed wood products and other formaldehyde-emitting goods. Even if you do not experience such reactions, you may wish to reduce your exposure as much as possible by purchasing exterior-grade products, which emit less formaldehyde. For further information on formaldehyde and consumer products, call the EPA Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) assistance line (202-554-1404).
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Some studies suggest that coating pressed wood products with polyurethane may reduce formaldehyde emissions for some period of time. To be effective, any such coating must cover all surfaces and edges and remain intact. Increase the ventilation and carefully follow the manufacturernstructions while applying these coatings. (If you are sensitive to formaldehyde, check the label contents before purchasing coating products to avoid buying products that contain formaldehyde, as they will emit the chemical for a short time after application.) Maintain moderate temperature and humidity levels and provide adequate ventilation.  The rate at which formaldehyde is released is accelerated by heat and may also depend somewhat on the humidity level. Therefore, the use of dehumidifiers and air conditioning to control humidity and to maintain a moderate temperature can help reduce formaldehyde emissions. (Drain and clean dehumidifier collection trays frequently so that they do not become a breeding ground for microorganisms.) Increasing the rate of ventilation in your home will also help in reducing formaldehyde levels.

    According to a recent survey, 75 percent of U.S. households used at least one <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/pesticid.html" target="_blank">pesticide</a> product indoors during the past year.  Products used most often are insecticides and disinfectants.  Another study suggests that 80 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides occurs indoors and that measurable levels of up to a dozen pesticides have been found in the air inside homes. The amount of pesticides found in homes appears to be greater than can be explained by recent pesticide use in those households; other possible sources include contaminated soil  or dust that floats or is tracked in from outside, stored pesticide containers, and household surfaces that collect and then release the pesticides.  Pesticides used in and around the home include products to control insects (insecticides), termites (termiticides), rodents (rodenticides), fungi (fungicides), and microbes (disinfectants). They are sold as sprays, liquids, sticks, powders, crystals, balls, and foggers.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1990, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported that some 79,000 children were involved in common household pesticide poisonings or exposures.  In households with children under five years old, almost one-half stored at least one pesticide product within reach of children.
  </p>

  <p>
    EPA registers pesticides for use and requires manufacturers to put information on the label about when and how to use the pesticide. It is important to remember that the "-cide" in pesticides means "to kill." <i>These products can be dangerous if not used properly.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to the active ingredient, pesticides are also made up of ingredients that are used to carry the active agent. These carrier agents are called "inerts" in pesticides because they are not toxic to the targeted pest; nevertheless, some inerts are capable of causing health problems.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects From Pesticides</strong></p>

  <p>
    Both the active and inert ingredients in pesticides can be organic compounds; therefore, both could add to the levels of airborne organics inside homes.  Both types of ingredients can cause the effects discussed in this document under "Household Products," however, as with other household products, there is insufficient understanding at present about what pesticide concentrations are necessary to produce these effects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Exposure to high levels of cyclodiene pesticides, commonly associated with misapplication, has produced various symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, muscle twitching, weakness, tingling sensations, and nausea. In addition, EPA is concerned that cyclodienes might cause long-term damage to the liver and the central nervous system, as well as an increased risk of cancer.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no further sale or commercial use permitted for the following cyclodiene or related pesticides: chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor.  The only exception is the use of heptachlor by utility companies to control fire ants in underground cable boxes.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Reducing Exposure to Pesticides in Homes</strong></p>

  <p>
    Read the label and follow the directions.  It is illegal to use any pesticide in any manner inconsistent with the directions on its label.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Unless you have had special training and are certified, never use a pesticide that is restricted to use by state-certified pest control operators.  Such pesticides are simply too dangerous for application by a noncertified person.  Use only the pesticides approved for use by the general public and then only in recommended amounts; increasing the amount does not offer more protection against pests and can be harmful to you and your plants and pets.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Ventilate the area well after pesticide use.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Mix or dilute pesticides outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and only in the amounts that will be immediately needed. If possible, take plants and pets outside when applying pesticides to them.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Use nonchemical methods of pest control when possible.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Since pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is prudent to reduce the use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well as indoors. Depending on the site and pest to be controlled, one or more of the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by making certain that wooden building materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood away from the home. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be dramatically reduced.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">If you decide to use a pest control company, choose one carefully.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Ask for an inspection of your home and get a written control program for evaluation before you sign a contract. The control program should list specific names of pests to be controlled and chemicals to be used; it should also reflect any of your safety concerns. Insist on a proven record of competence and customer satisfaction.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Dispose of unwanted pesticides safely.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    If you have unused or partially used pesticide containers you want to get rid of, dispose of them according to the directions on the label or on special household hazardous waste collection days. If there are no such collection days in your community, work with others to organize them.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Keep exposure to moth repellents to a minimum.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    One pesticide often found in the home is paradichlorobenzene, a commonly used active ingredient in moth repellents. This chemical is known to cause cancer in animals, but substantial scientific uncertainty exists over the effects, if any, of long-term human exposure to paradichlorobenzene.  EPA requires that products containing paradichlorobenzene bear warnings such as "avoid breathing vapors" to warn users of potential short-term toxic effects. Where possible, paradichlorobenzene, and items to be protected against moths, should be placed in trunks or other containers that can be stored in areas that are separately ventilated from the home, such as attics and detached garages. Paradichlorobenzene is also the key active ingredient in many air fresheners (in fact, some labels for moth repellents recommend that these same products be used as air fresheners or deodorants). Proper ventilation and basic household cleanliness will go a long way toward preventing unpleasant odors.

  <p><strong class="bold-color">ASBESTOS</strong></p>
  <p>
    <strong class="bold-color"><a href="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/asbestos.html" target="_blank">Asbestos</a></strong> is a mineral fiber that has been used commonly in a variety of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have banned several asbestos products. Manufacturers have also voluntarily limited uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most commonly found in older homes, in pipe and furnace insulation materials, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating materials, and floor tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Elevated concentrations of airborne asbestos can occur after asbestos-containing materials are disturbed by cutting, sanding or other remodeling activities. Improper attempts to remove these materials can release asbestos fibers into the air in homes, increasing asbestos levels and endangering people living in those homes.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects of Asbestos</strong></p>

  <p>
    The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can remain and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal).  Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until many years after exposure began.  Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and equipment brought home from job sites.

  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">If you think your home may have asbestos, dont panic!</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Usually it is best to leave asbestos material that is in good condition alone.  Generally, material in good condition will not release asbestos fiber.  There is no danger unless fibers are released and inhaled into the lungs.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Do not cut, rip, or sand asbestos-containing materials.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Leave undamaged materials alone and, to the extent possible, prevent them from being damaged, disturbed, or touched. Periodically inspect for damage or deterioration. Discard damaged or worn   asbestos gloves, stove-top pads, or ironing board covers.  Check with local health, environmental, or other appropriate officials to find out about proper handling and disposal procedures.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    If asbestos material is more than slightly damaged, or if you are going to make changes in your home that might disturb it, repair or removal by a professional is needed.  Before you have your house remodeled, find out whether asbestos materials are present.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">When you need to remove or clean up asbestos, use a professionally trained contractor.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Select a contractor only after careful discussion of the problems in your home and the steps the contractor will take to clean up or remove them.  Consider the option of sealing off the materials instead of removing them.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">LEAD</strong></p>

  <p>
    Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the <i><strong>"number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States."</strong></i> There are many ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other products.
  </p>

  <p>
    Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Health Effects of Exposure to Lead</strong></p>

  <p>
    Lead affects practically all systems within the body. At high levels it can cause convulsions, coma, and even death. Lower levels of lead can adversely affect the brain, central nervous system, blood cells, and kidneys.
  </p>

  <p>
    The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.  Fetuses , infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children may have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.
  </p>

  <p>
    Get your child tested for lead exposure. To find out where to do this, call your doctor or local health clinic. For more information on health effects, get a copy of the Centers for Disease Control's, Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children (October 1991).
  </P>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Ways to Reduce Exposure to Lead</strong></p>
  <p><strong class="bold-color">Keep areas where children play as dust-free and clean as possible.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Mop floors and wipe window ledges and chewable surfaces such as cribs with a solution of powdered automatic dishwasher detergent in warm water. (Dishwasher detergents are recommended because of their high content of phosphate.)  Most multi-purpose cleaners will not remove lead in ordinary dust.  Wash toys and stuffed animals regularly.  Make sure that children wash their hands before meals, nap time, and bedtime.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Reduce the risk from lead-based paint.</strong></p>
 
  <blockquote>
    Most homes built before 1960 contain heavily leaded paint.  Some homes built as recently as 1978 may also contain lead paint. This paint could be on window frames, walls, the outside of homes, or other surfaces.  Do not burn painted wood since it may contain lead.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Leave lead-based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition - do not sand or burn off paint that may contain lead.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Lead paint in good condition is usually not a problem except in places where painted surfaces rub against each other and  create dust (for example, opening a window).
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Do not remove lead paint yourself.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Individuals have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint because these activities generate large amounts of lead dust.  Consult your state health or housing department for suggestions on which private laboratories or public agencies may be able to help test your home for lead in paint.  Home test kits cannot detect small amounts of lead under some conditions.  Hire a person with special training for correcting lead paint problems to remove lead-based paint.  Occupants, especially children and pregnant women, should leave the building until all work is finished and clean-up is done.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    For additional information dealing with lead-based paint abatement contact the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the following two documents: Comprehensive and Workable Plan for the Abatement of Lead-Based Paint in Privately Owned Housing: Report to Congress (December 7, 1990) and Lead-Based Paint: Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement in Public and Indian Housing (September 1990).
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Do not bring lead dust into the home.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothes.  You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your home.  Soil very close to homes may be contaminated from lead paint on the outside of the building.  Soil by roads and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before entering the home.  If you work with lead in your job or a hobby, change your clothes before you go home and wash these clothes separately.  Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which sticks to fingers and toys.  Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come inside.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Find out about lead in drinking water.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Most well and city water does not usually contain lead.  Water usually picks up lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead materials.  The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested.  Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested.  Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Eat right.</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    A child who gets enough iron and calcium will absorb less lead.  Foods rich in iron include eggs, red meats, and beans.  Dairy products are high in calcium.  Do not store food or liquid in lead crystal glassware or imported or old pottery.  If you reuse old plastic bags to store or carry food, keep the printing on the outside of the bag.

  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">WHAT ABOUT CARPET?</strong></p>
  <p>
    In recent years, a number of consumers have associated a variety of symptoms with the installation of new carpet.  Scientists have not been able to determine whether the chemicals emitted by new carpets are responsible.  If you are installing new carpet, you may wish to take the following steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk to your carpet retailer.  Ask for information on emissions from carpet.</li>
    <li>Ask the retailer to unroll and air out the carpet in a well-ventilated area before installation.</li>
    <li>Ask for low-emitting adhesives if adhesives are needed.</li>
    <li>Consider leaving the premises during and immediately after carpet installation.  You may wish to schedule the installation when most family members or office workers are out.</li>
    <li>Be sure the retailer requires the installer to follow the Carpet and Rug Institute's installation guidelines.</li>
    <li>Open doors and windows.  Increasing the amount of fresh air in the home will reduce exposure to most chemicals released from carpet.  During and after installation, use window fans, room air conditioners, or other mechanical ventilation equipment you may have installed in your house, to exhaust fumes to the outdoors.  Keep them running for 48 to 72 hours after the new carpet is installed.</li>
    <li>Contact your carpet retailer if objectionable odors persist.</li>
    <li>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper carpet maintenance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">WHEN BUILDING A NEW HOME</strong></p>
  <p>
    Building a new home provides the opportunity for preventing indoor air problems.  However, it can result in exposure to higher levels of indoor air contaminants if careful attention is not given to potential pollution sources and the air exchange rate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Express your concerns about indoor air quality to your architect or builder and enlist his or her cooperation in taking measures to provide good indoor air quality.  Talk both about purchasing building materials and furnishings that are low-emitting and about providing an adequate amount of ventilation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a ventilation rate of 0.35 ach (air changes per hour) for new homes, and some new homes are built to even tighter specifications. Particular care should be given in such homes to preventing the build-up of indoor air pollutants to high levels.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Here are a few important actions that can make a difference:</strong></p>
  <p>Use radon-resistant construction techniques.</p>
  <p>
    Obtain a copy of the EPA booklet, <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/radon/pubs/newconst.html" target="_blank">Model Standards and Techniques for Control of Radon in New Residential Buildings</a>, from your <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/contacts.html">state radon office</a> or health agency, your state homebuilders' association, or your EPA regional office. <i>[You can also visit EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/construc.html" target="_blank">Radon Resistant New Construction (RRNC)</a> site on the WWW.]</i>
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Choose building materials and furnishings that will keep indoor air pollution to a minimum.</strong></p>

  <p>
    There are many actions a homeowner can take to select products that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are mentioned here.  First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces.  Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes wet.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Provide proper drainage and seal foundations in new construction.</strong></p>
 
  <p><strong class="bold-color">Air that enters the home through the foundation can contain more moisture than is generated from all occupant activities.</strong></p>

  <p><strong class="bold-color">Become familiar with mechanical ventilation systems and consider installing one.</strong></p>
 
  <p>
    Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home.  Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers).
  </p>

  <p>Ensure that combustion appliances, including furnaces, fireplaces, woodstoves, and heaters, are properly vented and receive enough supply air.</p>

  <p>
    Combustion gases, including carbon monoxide, and particles can be back-drafted from the chimney or flue into the living space if the combustion appliance is not properly vented or does not receive enough supply air.  Back-drafting can be a particular problem in weatherized or tightly constructed homes.  Installing a dedicated outdoor air supply for the combustion appliance can help prevent backdrafting.
