    <p align="center"><strong>Our inspections are from an engineering point of view.</strong></p>
    <p>Even before we arrive at your property for inspection, we already studied your property through USGS, Satellite Maps and Mine Maps (where available). </p>
    <p>We report the condition of the physical components, structures and foundations. We recommend maintenance items and educate our buyers during an inspection. We keep in touch with you as long as you want to keep in touch with us. We will help you during your ownership of the property. <br>
    <br></p>
    <p>Home inspectors do not judge or evaluate the home for cost or value, but do report objectively in writing the specific condition of the subject home's condition and the subsequent physical systems involved. <br>
    <br></p>
    <p>A home inspection is an independent, unbiased review and report on a home's systems, components and their condition. Consumers and real estate professionals should expect no less than full professionalism, education, competence, credentials, knowledge, and courtesy. <br>
    <br></p>
    <p><img alt="aaHomeInspec" src="images/homepic2.jpg" width="245" align="right" height="185" hspace="10">A detailed home inspection usually takes two to three hours or longer, depending on the home's age and square footage. We recommend that you be present at your home inspection so that you can ask your inspector any questions and to look at any areas needing maintenance or repair. <br>
    <br>
    Please take the time to look through our web site. We've included a wealth of information which will help you better understand the ins and outs of home inspection, and we hope this information will be useful to you. <br>
