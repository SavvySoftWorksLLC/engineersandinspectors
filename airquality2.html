<div class="head3"><A NAME="Improve1"><I><B>Indoor Air and Your Health</B></I></A></div>

<P>Health effects from indoor air pollutants may be experienced soon after exposure or, possibly,
years later.</P>

<P>Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are usually short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.</P>

<P>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.</P>

<P>Certain immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the time and place the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.</P>

<P>Other health effects may show up either years after exposure has occurred or only after long or repeated periods of exposure. These effects, which include some respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer, can be severely debilitating or fatal.  It is prudent to try to improve the indoor air quality in your home even if symptoms are not noticeable.  More information on potential health effects from particular indoor air pollutants is provided in the section, "<A HREF="http://apartments.about.com/library/articles/bl_airquality3.htm">A Look at Source-Specific Controls.</A>"</P>

<P>While pollutants commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. People also react very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research is needed to better understand which health effects occur after exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which occur from the higher concentrations that occur for short periods of time.</P>

<P>The health effects associated with some indoor air pollutants are summarized in the section "<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/insidest.html#Refguide">Reference Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the Home</A>."</P>

<div class="head3"><A NAME="Improve2"><I>Identifying Air Quality Problems</I></A></div>

<P>Some health effects can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality problem, especially if they appear after a person moves to a new residence, remodels or refurnishes a home, or treats a home with pesticides. If you think that you have symptoms that may be related to your home environment, discuss them with your doctor or your local health department to see if they could be caused by indoor air pollution. You may also want to consult a board-certified allergist or an
occupational medicine specialist for answers to your questions.</P>

<P>Another way to judge whether your home has or could develop indoor air problems is to identify  potential sources of indoor air pollution.  Although the presence of such sources does not necessarily mean that you have an indoor air quality problem, being aware of the type and number of potential sources is an important step toward assessing the air quality in your home.</P>

<P>A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution.  Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your home may not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy.  To detect odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.</P>

<div class="head3"><A NAME="Improve3"><I>Measuring Pollutant Levels</I></A></div>

<P>The federal government recommends that you measure the level of radon in your home.  Without measurements there is no way to tell whether radon is present because it is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Inexpensive devices are available for measuring radon. EPA provides guidance as to risks associated with different levels of exposure and when the public should consider corrective action. There are specific mitigation techniques that have proven effective in reducing levels of radon in the home. (See "<A HREF="http://apartments.about.com/library/articles/bl_airquality3.htm#Look1">Radon</A>"  for additional information about testing and controlling radon in homes.)</P>

<P>For pollutants other than radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptoms or signs of poor ventilation and specific sources or pollutants have been identified as possible causes of indoor air quality problems. Testing for many pollutants can be expensive.  Before monitoring your home for pollutants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals who have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial buildings.</P>

<div class="head3"><A NAME="Improve4"><I>Weatherizing Your Home</I></A></div>

<P>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. In addition, residents should be alert to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth.  Additional weatherization measures should not be undertaken until these problems have been corrected.</P>

<P>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air.  (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.)  However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.</P>

<div class="head3"><A NAME="Improve5"><I><B>Three Basic Strategies</B></I></A></div>

<P><B>Source Control</B></P>

<P>Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.  In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.</P>

<P><B>Ventilation Improvements</B></P>

<P>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors.  Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.  Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate.  Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.</P>

<P>It is particularly important to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants--for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather permits.</P>

<P>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home.  Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers).  For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116;  (800) 523-2929.</P>

<P><B>Air Cleaners</B></P>

<P>There are many types and sizes of air cleaners on the market, ranging from relatively inexpensive table-top models to sophisticated and expensive whole-house systems. Some air cleaners are highly effective at particle removal, while others, including most table-top models, are much less so. Air cleaners are generally not designed to remove gaseous pollutants.</P>

<P>The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.</P>

<P>Another important factor in determining the effectiveness of an air cleaner is the strength of the pollutant source. Table-top air cleaners, in particular, may not remove satisfactory amounts of pollutants from strong nearby sources. People with a sensitivity to particular sources may find that air cleaners are helpful only in conjunction with concerted efforts to remove the source.</P>

<P>Over the past few years, there has been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments.  There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants remove significant quantities of pollutants in homes and offices.  Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because overly damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals.</P>

<P>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not diminish the amount of  radon entering the home. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of reducing the health risk from radon.  EPA's booklet, <A href="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/pubs/residair.html">Residential Air-Cleaning Devices</A>, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air pollutants.</P>

<P>For most indoor air quality problems in the home, source control is the most effective solution. This section takes a source-by-source look at the most common indoor air pollutants, their potential health effects, and ways to reduce levels in the home. For a summary of the points made in this section, see "<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/insidest.html#Refguide">Reference Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the Home</A>."  The EPA has recently released, "<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/pubs/ozonegen.html">Ozone Generators That Are Sold As Air Cleaners</A>."  The purpose of this document (which is only available via this web site) is to provide accurate information regarding the use of ozone-generating devices in indoor occupied spaces. This information is based on the most credible scientific evidence currently available.</P>

<P>EPA has recently published, <A href="http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/pubs/airduct.html">"Should You Have the Air Ducts in Your Home Cleaned?"</A> EPA-402-K-97-002, October 1997. This document is  intended to help consumers answer this often confusing question.  The  document explains what air duct
cleaning is, provides guidance to help consumers decide whether to have the service performed in their home, and provides helpful information for choosing a duct cleaner, determining if duct cleaning was done properly, and how to prevent contamination of air ducts. </P>
